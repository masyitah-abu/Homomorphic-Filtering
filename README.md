# Homomorphic-Filtering

- What is Homomorphic Filtering?
  - Homorphic Filtering involving a nonlinear mapping to a different domain in which linear filter techniques are applied, followed by mapping back to the original domain.
  - In this project a raw image that added with noise will be used to see the performance of the filter.

- This algorithm consist several process
  1. Add speckle noise into the original image
  2. Filter noise added using homomorphic filtering
      - There are three class of homomorphic filtering is developed following this formula:-
        - First class follow Equation 1 =
        - Second Class follow Equation 2 =
        - Third Class follow Equation 3 =
  3. Then, the performance of homomorphic filtering will be measured.
